The military press is an exercise with many names and is often referred to as the shoulder press, overhead press, and strict press. The military press is used primarily to build the deltoid muscle. It also indirectly targets the other muscles of the shoulder, your triceps, and your core. Since the military press is completed standing up, it involves a lot of core strength to help stabilize the spine while pressing weight overhead. There are a number of variations to the military press you can use to target the deltoids from different angles and different ways. These military press variations include: Seated Military Press Dumbbell Military Press Seated Dumbbell Press Arnold Press Behind The Neck Military Press Smith Machine Military Press Be sure to add a variation of the military press to your shoulder workout to get the benefits from one of the most complete shoulder exercises out there.',
