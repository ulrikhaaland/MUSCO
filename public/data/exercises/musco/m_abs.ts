            Incline Plank: Use a bench or sturdy surface. Place your forearms on the bench and your feet on the floor, forming a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core and hold for 30 seconds.
            Knee Plank: Start in a standard plank position but with your knees on the ground instead of your toes. Keep your body in a straight line from head to knees, engaging your core. Hold for 30 seconds.`,
