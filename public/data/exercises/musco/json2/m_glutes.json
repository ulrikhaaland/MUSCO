It will also indirectly target the other muscles of the legs such as the hamstrings, quads, and calves. hip thrust variations are thought to be the optimal exercise for glute specific training. So, if you have goals to build a bigger butt, hip thrusts should be included in your workouts. Building strong glutes will also have a positive carryover into your other exercises including squat variations and deadlift variations.
