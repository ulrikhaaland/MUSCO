      "description": "The Standing Hammer Curl uses a neutral‑grip to emphasize the brachialis and brachioradialis while still hitting the biceps brachii. Because the wrists remain in a thumbs‑up position, the movement is joint‑friendly and allows heavier loading than a supinated curl. It is ideal for adding overall arm thickness and forearm strength while reducing wrist strain.",
