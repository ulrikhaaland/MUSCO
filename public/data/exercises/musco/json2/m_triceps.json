      "description": "The rope tricep extension is a variation of the cable tricep extension and an exercise used to build the muscles of the triceps. Well-built triceps also have a lot of positive carryover into your pressing movements such as bench press variations and shoulder press variations. The rope tricep extension can be included in your tricep workouts, upper body workouts, push workouts, and full body workouts.",
