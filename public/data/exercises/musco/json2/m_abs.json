      "description": "The hanging leg raise is a high‑tension abdominal exercise that targets the lower rectus abdominis while demanding serious grip and shoulder stability. Each strict leg lift forces the hip flexors and deep core to keep the torso motionless, teaching full‑body control and improving posture. Because it requires only a sturdy bar, it is a staple for calisthenics athletes, gymnasts, and lifters seeking sharper mid‑section definition. Progressively adding ankle weights or a dumbbell between the feet keeps the movement challenging even for advanced trainees.",
