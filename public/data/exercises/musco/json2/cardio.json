This full-body HIIT workout produces substantial improvements in cardiovascular fitness, power output, and muscular endurance by pushing your system to 85-95% of maximum capacity during work intervals. The rowing machine's full-body engagement makes this one of the most efficient and effective interval protocols for overall conditioning.",
