Engage your core and hold for 30 seconds.\n          Knee Plank: Start in a standard plank position but with your knees on the ground instead of your toes. Keep your body in a straight line from head to knees, engaging your core. Hold for 30 seconds.",

      "name": "Dead Bug with Plates",
      "description": "The deadbug with plates is an exercise used to strengthen the muscles of the abs, and is a variation of the dead bug. The deadbug works as an anti-extension abdominal exercise in which you must keep the spine stable as you slowly raise your arm overhead. The deadbug gets its name because you look like a dead bug on its back with its legs in the air when you are performing the exercise. The dead bug with plates adds weight to the dead bug exercise as a form of progression. This would be an excellent choice for those who have mastered the bodyweight variation of this exercise.",

Most ab workouts include the ab crunch as it is thought to be one of the best core building exercises. However, instead of performing marathon sets of ab crunches, it is best to pair it with other ab movements such as the plank and hanging leg raise to get a complete ab workout. The ab crunch replaced the sit up as the corner stone ab exercise. This is because people believed the sit up involved too much flexion which lends itself to lower back pain. Thus, it was replaced by the ab crunch, which accomplished the same movement pattern without overextending the spine. Some may still experience low back pain performing the ab crunch. If this is the case, it is best to stick with ab exercises that focus more on stability and less on flexion such as the plank.",

      "description": "The weighted straight leg toe touch is an abdominal exercise used to strengthen the core. It is a weighted variation of the straight leg toe touch. By adding weight to the exercise, you can achieve progressive overload, which is a key to building bigger and stronger muscles. The weighted straight leg toe touch is a flexion based exercise. Some may experience low back pain when performing flexion based exercises. If this is the case, stick to performing abdominal exercises that focus on stability.",
