      "Focus on keeping the reps slow and controlled. Because this is an isolation exercise, the focus should be on correctly working the muscle - not moving as much weight as possible.",
      `Don't bring your arms up too high - up to shoulder height is far enough.`,
      `If you encounter pain in the shoulder while performing the movement, consider implementing one of the following tweaks:
        Tilt your pinkies slightly higher than your thumbs. Imagine you’re pouring out a cup of water.
        Turn your palms forward so that your thumbs are pointing away from your body. This will put the shoulder in a more externally rotated position and potentially open up the shoulder joint to allow for a bit more movement.`,
