      "description": "The military press is a complete shoulder building exercise perfect for building shoulder muscle. The military press is an exercise with many names and is often referred to as the shoulder press, overhead press, and strict press. The military press is used primarily to build the deltoid muscle. It also indirectly targets the other muscles of the shoulder, your triceps, and your core. Since the military press is completed standing up, it involves a lot of core strength to help stabilize the spine while pressing weight overhead. There are a number of variations to the military press you can use to target the deltoids from different angles and different ways. These military press variations include: Seated Military Press Dumbbell Military Press Seated Dumbbell Press Arnold Press Behind The Neck Military Press Smith Machine Military Press Be sure to add a variation of the military press to your shoulder workout to get the benefits from one of the most complete shoulder exercises out there.",

        "Keep momentum out of the movement and don’t add any additional leg drive by flexing and extending the knees.",
        "Squeeze your glutes and brace your abs as you press. You shouldn’t be leaning back excessively as you press.",
        "Imagine you’re trying to look out a window at the top, your ears should be in line with your biceps.",
        "If your shoulders are bothering you during the movement, consider experimenting with a wider grip or utilizing some of the vertical pressing progressions listed on the site.",
        "You can use a staggered stance to prevent the lower back from arching excessively but if you still can’t control the anterior core then consider using a half kneeling regression shown on the site."

The use of an exercise ball instead of a bench provides a unique challenge as the exercise ball forces you to engage your core muscles to stabilize the weight. The overhead press is a foundational movement for establishing baseline strength and building a completely balanced physique. The exercise can be included in shoulder workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, and full body workouts.",
