      "description": "The banded “Y” is an exercise used to target the muscles of the shoulder. The banded “Y” is primarily used as a prehab and warm up exercise. It utilizes bands to provide accommodating resistance, where more pressure is applied to the target muscle group the closer one gets to full contraction during the exercise.",
