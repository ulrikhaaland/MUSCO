        'The fire hydrant circle drill is a form of dynamic stretching often used to warm up the muscles of the hip flexors prior to heavy leg training. The hip flexors can become quite tight throughout the day, especially if you work a desk job. Increasing mobility of the joint and its surrounding muscles is critical for injury preventions. This couldn’t be truer for heavily loaded exercises such as the barbell back squat. The drill gets its name due to its resemblance of how dogs stereotypically react to seeing a fire hydrant.',
