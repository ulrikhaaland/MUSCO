      "steps": [
        "Select the desired weight from the rack, then take a few steps back into an open area.",
        "Take a deep breath and raise the dumbbells to shoulder height using a neutral grip (palms facing in) while keeping the elbows slightly bent.",
        "Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position under control.",
        "Repeat for the desired number of repetitions."
      ],
      "tips": [
        "Focus on keeping the reps slow and controlled. Because this is an isolation exercise, the focus should be on correctly working the muscle - not moving as much weight as possible.",
        "Don"t bring your arms up too high - up to shoulder height is far enough.",
        "If you encounter pain in the shoulder while performing the movement, consider implementing one of the following "tweaks":\n          Tilt your pinkies slightly higher than your thumbs. Imagine you’re pouring out a cup of water.\n          Turn your palms forward so that your thumbs are pointing away from your body. This will put the shoulder in a more externally rotated position and potentially open up the shoulder joint to allow for a bit more movement.",
