      "name": "Half Kneeling Battling Rope",
      "description": "The half kneeling battling rope exercise is a rope slam variation and an exercise used to primarily target the muscles of the shoulders, arms, and core. Battle rope exercises, such as the half kneeling rope drill, are best used as a form of conditioning to get your heart rate up. Alternatively, they can be used as an excellent shoulder finisher during your push or shoulder workouts.",

      "steps": [
        "Setup in a half kneeling position while holding a rope in either hand with a neutral grip.",
        "Alternate small waves with each rope by slamming them to the floor in a quick rhythmic fashion.",
        "Repeat for the desired time, duration, or reps."
      ],
      "tips": [
        "Keep some tension through the core to help transmit force through the floor and keep the spine somewhat neutral as your extremities are moving.",
        "You can alternate between waves and slams if you prefer some variety.",
        "If you have a lower body injury, can’t seem to maintain a neutral spine during some of the other battling rope variations, or you’re trying to limit lower body volume for whatever reason, this would be an excellent option to include in your training.\n          If you struggle with back pain or maintaining a neutral spine, utilize the following "progression": seated, half kneeling, talling kneeling, split stance, standing.",
        "If you struggle with back pain or maintaining a neutral spine, utilize the following progression: seated, half kneeling, talling kneeling, split stance, standing.",
        "You can progress the movement by utilizing heavier ropes, changing the difficulty of the rope slam (i.e. utilizing variations that involve more joints), or by increasing the duration/repetitions."
