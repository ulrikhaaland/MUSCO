        "To get into the starting position bend your knees slightly and let the barbell slide down your thighs until it drops just below knee level.",
        "Continue to hinge at your hips until your back is almost parallel to the floor and keep your feet around shoulder-width apart.",
        "Now pull the barbell up towards your neck.",
        "Squeeze your rear delts at the top of the movement. Then slowly lower the bar back to the start position.",

      ],
      "tips": [

        "And finally (most importantly) keep your back straight. If you bend at the back, you"re using too much weight."
