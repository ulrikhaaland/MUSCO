      description:
        'The incline dumbbell curl is a variation of the dumbbell curl and an exercise used to build bigger biceps. The biceps is a tricky (and fun) muscle to target and putting yourself in various degrees of incline can help manipulate the range of motion for either a tighter contraction or deeper stretch. The incline dumbbell curl elongates the negative portion of the dumbbell curl, creating a deeper stretch on the biceps muscle tissue. Dumbbell curl variations are primarily popular among lifters looking to improve their aesthetics as direct arm work will have limited carry over into maximum strength.',

The Zottman curl utilizes different hand positioning at different portions of the lift to capitalize on the strength of the lifter and maximize arm growth. The first portion, the regular curl, allows the lifter to focus on their bicep strength. The lowering portion, after already using a heavier weight than one would typically use in a dumbbell reverse curl, allows you to overload the forearms.

        'The seated dumbbell reverse curl is a curl variation used to target the biceps and forearms. By remaining seated during the seated dumbbell reverse curl, you eliminate the ability to arch your back and swing the weight up to the finishing position of the exercise. This provides a better isolation and contraction on the biceps. Performing curls utilizing a reverse grip, as seen in the seated dumbbell reverse curl, includes the forearms in the exercise to a far greater extent. And since you’re likely able to curl more weight than you can wrist roll, you’ll better stimulate the muscle fibers of the forearm to encourage more muscle growth.',

      description:
        'The Zottman preacher curl is a variation of the Zottman curl and an exercise used to strengthen the muscles of the biceps. The Zottman curl utilizes different hand positioning at different portions of the lift to capitalize on the strength of the lifter and maximize arm growth. The first portion, the regular dumbbell curl, allows the lifter to focus on their bicep strength. The lowering portion, after already using a heavier weight than one would typically use in a dumbbell reverse curl, allows you to overload the forearms. Using a preacher bench will assist in helping one isolate the biceps and also put the arm in a bit of a forward position to assist with maximum contraction. Bicep isolation work is particularly helpful for those looking to achieve aesthetics and building a balanced physique.',

        'Don’t allow the elbows to shift. Similarly, make sure the shoulder doesn’t shift forward in the socket as you lower the weight.',
