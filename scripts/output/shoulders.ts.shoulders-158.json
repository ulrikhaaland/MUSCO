      "name": "Seated Alternating Dumbbell Front Raise",
      "description": "The alternating dumbbell front raise is a shoulder exercise used to target the front deltoids. The front deltoid is involved in several pressing movements and working to increase the strength of this muscle group can have a positive carry-over into your heavy pushing lifts. From an aesthetics standpoint, bigger front deltoids can lead to the appearance of a complete set of shoulders and a wider framed upper body. Performing unilateral movements can help improve weaknesses, balance your strength and aesthetic physique, and work towards reducing injuries by addressing imbalances in the body.",
