      "name": "Smith Machine Shoulder Press",
      "description": "The Smith machine shoulder press is a variation of the barbell shoulder press and is used to strengthen the muscles of the shoulders. Utilizing a Smith machine will ensure the bar path remains in a fixed position, eliminating some of the need to stabilize during the exercise. It"s also a viable option for moving heavy weight without a spotter. The overhead press is a foundational movement for establishing baseline strength and building a completely balanced physique. The exercise can be included in shoulder workouts, push workouts, upper body workouts, and full body workouts.",

      "steps": [
        "Place an adjustable bench in the Smith machine and adjust the back to a 90-degree angle.",
        "Adjust the bar to around eye level and load the desired weight on the bar.",
        "Position your hands around shoulder-width apart and unrack the bar using a pronated grip. This is the starting position for the movement.",
        "Press the bar overhead by extending the elbows and contracting the deltoids.",
        "Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position (the arms should be roughly 90 degrees or slightly lower depending on limb lengths).",
        "Repeat for the desired number of repetitions."

      "tips": [
        "Don’t allow the head to jut forward excessively.",
        "Drive the bicep to the ear and exhale as you press.",
        "If you sense any pressure in your neck or traps during the movement, look to address a lack of thoracic spine extension or shoulder flexion.",
        "If you can’t lock out the elbows overhead then it may indicate a lack of shoulder mobility due to poor scapular upward rotation."
