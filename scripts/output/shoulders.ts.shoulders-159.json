      "name": "Alternating Rear Delt Fly",
      "description": "The alternating dumbbell rear delt fly is a variation of the dumbbell reverse fly, also known as the rear delt fly. It"s a great exercise to assist you in building a complete set of shoulders. Many lifters utilize this exercise to target the rear delts, an often lagging muscle for many lifters alike. Strengthening the rear delts can lead to improved posture and a greater level of strength on other lifts.",

      "steps": [
        "Set up for the exercise by grasping a pair of dumbbells with a neutral grip (palms facing each other) and standing with your feet around shoulder width apart.",
        "Bend slightly at the knees and bring your torso forward by bending at the waist.",
        "Each elbow should be slightly bent and the dumbbells should be directly under your chest. This is the starting position.",
        "Take a deep breath and raise one dumbbell towards the ceiling in a semi-circular motion using the rear deltoids, until your arm is parallel to the floor.",
        "Slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position under control.",
        "Immediately repeat the movement with your opposite arm. This is one rep.",
        "Repeat for the desired number of repetitions"
      ],
      "tips": [
        "Ideally we want to focus on the rear deltoids, not the scapular retractors so movement at the shoulder blade should be limited. Move the shoulder within the joint, not the shoulder blade on the rib cage.",
        "Keep the core braced and don’t arch the back at the top of the movement.",
        "If you can’t hinge to 90 degrees then hinge as far as comfortably possible while completing the exercise. Or, you could also take a seated position to complete the exercise as well.",
        "If you experience shoulder pain during the movement then it may be beneficial to rotate the dumbbells until the thumbs are pointing away from one another and the palms are facing forward. This is also known as a supinated grip and will externally rotate the shoulder.",
        "Allow the arms to move freely but don’t lock out the elbows."
