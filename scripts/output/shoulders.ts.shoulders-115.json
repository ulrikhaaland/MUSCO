      "name": "Lateral Raise Partials",
      "description": "The lateral raise partials exercise is a variation of the dumbbell lateral raise used to isolate the muscles of the shoulder. Performing partial movements is a strength building technique that can be applied to all movements. Doing so allows you to train a certain portion of the range of motion for any given exercise with a heavier weight than you’d be able to use otherwise for the exercise.",

        "Select the desired weight from the rack then take a few steps back into an open area.",

        "Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position under control.",

      "tips": [
        "These work especially well when supersetted with full range laterals with lighter weight.",
        "If you want to keep more tension through the side delts, don’t allow the weights to touch your sides and control the eccentric (lowering) portion of the movement.",
        "Keep the abs braced and don’t lean back or arch the back at the top of the movement.",
        "Allow the arms to move freely but don’t lock out the elbows.",
        "If you encounter pain in the shoulder while performing the movement, consider implement one of the following "tweaks":\n          Tilt your pinkies slightly higher than your thumbs. Imagine you’re pouring out a cup of water.\n          Turn your palms forward so that your thumbs are pointing away from your body. This will put the shoulder in a more externally rotated position and potentially open up the shoulder joint to allow for a bit more movement.",
