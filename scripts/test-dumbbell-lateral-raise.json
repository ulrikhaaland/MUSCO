  "name": "Dumbbell Lateral Raise",
  "description": "The dumbbell lateral raise is a shoulder exercise used to strengthen the muscles of the shoulder. It's a good exercise for building width in your upper body which gives you the \"V\" shape.",
  "steps": [
    "Select the desired weight from the rack, then take a few steps back into an open area.",
    "Take a deep breath and raise the dumbbells to shoulder height using a neutral grip (palms facing in) while keeping the elbows slightly bent.",
    "Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position under control.",
    "Repeat for the desired number of repetitions."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Focus on keeping the reps slow and controlled",
    "Because this is an isolation exercise, the focus should be on correctly working the muscle - not moving as much weight as possible",
    "Don't bring your arms up too high - up to shoulder height is far enough",
    "If you encounter pain in the shoulder while performing the movement, consider implementing one of the following tweaks:",
    "Tilt your pinkies slightly higher than your thumbs",
    "Imagine you’re pouring out a cup of water",
    "Turn your palms forward so that your thumbs are pointing away from your body",
    "This will put the shoulder in a more externally rotated position and potentially open up the shoulder joint to allow for a bit more movement",
