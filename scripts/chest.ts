      description: "The dumbbell bench press is a variation of the barbell bench press and an exercise used to build the muscles of the chest. Often times, the dumbbell bench press is recommended after reaching a certain point of strength on the barbell bench press to avoid pec and shoulder injuries. Additionally, the dumbbell bench press provides an ego check in the amount of weight used due to the need to maintain shoulder stability throughout the exercise. The exercise itself can be featured as a main lift in your workouts or an accessory lift to the bench press depending on your goals.",

      name: "Barbell Bench Press",
      description: "The barbell bench press is a classic exercise popular among all weight lifting circles. From bodybuilders to powerlifters, the bench press is a staple chest exercise in nearly every workout program. For powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, 1 rep max on bench press is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the bench press is a compound exercise that targets many of the muscles in your upper body. By performing the bench press, you primarily work your pectoralis major (your chest). Other muscles which assist in moving the barbell during a bench press are other muscles of the chest, triceps, and shoulders. Not everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell bench press, so several variations have been created to ensure people can train this crucial movement pattern in a safe and comfortable way. Some of these variations include: Incline bench press Decline bench press, Dumbbell bench press Dumbbell incline bench press Dumbbell decline bench press Smith machine bench press Those with shoulder injuries can also utilize many of the alternative barbells out there that place less pressure on the shoulder to bench press. Some of these variations include hex bar bench press, football bar bench press, and Swiss bar bench press.",

      description: "The dumbbell crush press is a variation of the dumbbell bench press and an exercise used to build the muscles of the chest and triceps. The crush press is particularly effective in activating the chest as you’ll squeeze the pecs while pressing the dumbbells together. Additionally, the crush press incorporates the triceps more so than other bench press variations. This exercise is useful for bodybuilders trying to establish mind-muscle connection with their chest, as well as other lifters looking to build stronger triceps to assist them in other press variations.",

        "Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.",
        "Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.",
        "If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.",
        "Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.",
        "Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.",
        "The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.",
        "As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path.",
        "Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.",
        "Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.",
        "Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.",
        "Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.",
        "Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.",
        "The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.",
        "Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.",
        "Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.",
        "Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.",
        "Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” in order to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.",

The slight change in hand placement used in the wide grip incline bench press allows the lifter to place more emphasis on the chest muscle during the exercise, when compared to its closer grip counter parts. The incline used in the wide grip incline bench press also allows one to target the upper chest better. This can be extremely beneficial if your upper chest is a lagging muscle group.",

      tips: [
        "Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.",
        "Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.",
        "If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.",
        "Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplishes the same thing: “Flare and push”.",
        "Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.",
        "The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.",
        "As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.",
        "Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.",
        "Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.",
        "Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.",
        "Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.",
        "Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.",
        "The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.",
        "Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.",
        "Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.",
        "Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.",
        "Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.",
        "Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.",

The medicine ball used increases the range of motion slightly on the side it is positioned. This slight elevation will also provide a core challenge as you stabilize the body during the push up range of motion.",

        "Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.",
        "As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.",
        "Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.",
        "Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.",
        "Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.",
        "Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.",
        "Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.",
        "Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.",
        "The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.",
        "Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.",
        "Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.",
        "Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.",
        "Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.",
        "Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.",

        "Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.",
        "Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.",
        "As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.",
        "Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.",
        "Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.",
        "Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.",
        "Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.",
        "Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.",
        "Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.",
        "The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.",
        "Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.",
        "Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.",
        "Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.",
        "Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.",
        "Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.",

      tips: [
        "Always use the half kneeling variation first before progressing to the standing version as this version will help to limit excessive rotation within the lumbar spine by disassociating the pelvis (aka one leg in hip flexion while the other in hip extension).",
        `Watch for a variety of compensations which typically present when someone has excessive tone within the pecs:
          The shoulders will rotate
          The spine will hyperextend
          The arm will internally rotate
          The humerus will pop forward in the socket (typically coupled with shoulder elevated and scapular anterior tilt)`,
        "The shoulders will rotate",
        "The spine will hyperextend",
        "The arm will internally rotate",
        "The humerus will pop forward in the socket (typically coupled with shoulder elevated and scapular anterior tilt)",
        "Ensure that you exhale as you rotate the PVC up and away from you, this will help to cue abdominal engage and prevent you from hyperextending. Also, this can help one to ensure that the scapular moves efficiently on the ribcage rather than just tilting the ribcage back."

The kettlebells will dangle from the barbell via resistance bands and each side will sway during the range of motion. This instability will help strengthen your push muscles and is especially practical when it comes to sports specific performance.

        "Hanging band training is very beneficial for increasing shoulder stability within the bench. If you find that you can’t control the bar due to excessive shaking then try to squeeze the bar harder to increase a phenomenon in the shoulder known as irradiation leading to further shoulder stability.",
        "Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.",
        "Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.",
        "If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.",
        "Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplishes the same thing: “Flare and push”.",
        "Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.",
        "The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.",
        "As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.",
        "Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.",
        "Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.",
        "Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.",
        "Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.",
        "Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.",
        "The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.",
        "Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.",
        "Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.",
        "Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.",
        "Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.",
        "Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.",

        "Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplishes the same thing: “Flare and push”.",
        "Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.",

        "Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.",
        "Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.",
        "Experiment with grip width - if you have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.",

        "Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.",
        "Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.",

        "Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.",

        "Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.",
        "Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.",

        "Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.",

        "Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.",
        "Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.",

The wide grip barbell bench press is a variation of the bench press that utilizes a slight change in hand positioning to alter the range of motion and emphasis on the muscles targeted during the exercise. The wide grip barbell bench press places slightly more tension on the chest muscles to move the weight when compared to its closer grip counterparts.

      ],
      tips: [
        "Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.",
        "Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.",
        "If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.",
        "Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.",
        "Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.",
        "The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.",
        "As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.",
        "Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.",
        "Fight the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.",
        "Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.",
        "Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.",
        "Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.",
        "Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.",
        "The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.",
        "Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.",
        "Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.",
        "Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off to maintain tension through the upper back.",
        "Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.",
        "Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.",
        "The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement."

        "If you find a tender spot, pause for 5-6 seconds and focus on slow, deep breaths and try to relax.",
        "Do not roll the front of the shoulder directly as this can cause irritation to the biceps tendon and anterior capsule.",
        "Performing SMR may be uncomfortable but that’s not an excuse to avoid it. It hurts because there may be physiological or neurological influences generating a pain response. The more you roll the better it’ll feel provided there’s no serious underlying mechanism.",
        "If you notice any burning, numbness, or tingling, keep moving past that area. It’s likely a nerve and pausing on it for any length of time would not be a good idea.",
        "If you find a sensitive spot, pause for a second and take the joint through flexion and extension. This a method of active release known as “tack and floss”."

      tips: [
        "The reverse grip bench press is a variation of the barbell bench press. Rep timing should be slow enough that you control the weight on the way down.

        `Keep your feet firmly planted on the floor. Your feet provide the stabilization for the lift, if you hold them up or move them around you're more likely to lose balance.`,
        `Make sure you lower the bar straight down to your middle chest and push it straight up. Don't deviate from this range of motion.`,
        `Your glutes and shoulder blades should be touching the bench at all times throughout the set. It's OK to arch the back as long as the glutes and shoulder blades are fixed.`,
