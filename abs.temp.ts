      name: "Cable Crunch",
      description: "The Cable Crunch is an effective core exercise that targets the abdominal muscles, particularly the rectus abdominis. Unlike floor crunches, the cable crunch reduces neck strain by allowing you to focus on using your abs without needing to lift your head or shoulders. It also helps improve spinal flexion, a fundamental movement for building a strong, functional core. This exercise helps strengthen and define the core, improve posture, and enhance overall abdominal endurance. Proper form is crucial to avoid strain on the lower back and ensure maximum activation of the ab muscles.",

      tips: [
        "Use controlled movements. Perform the crunch slowly and with control to maximize muscle engagement and avoid injury.",
        "Focus on crunching with your abs, not pulling with your arms. The arms should only guide the rope.",
        "Avoid arching your back too much. Keep the motion in your torso to protect your spine.",

        `If you're new to planks, it's important to build strength and endurance gradually. Here’s a beginner progression to help you work up to a full plank:
          Wall Plank: Stand facing a wall and place your hands on it at shoulder height. Step your feet back slightly and bend your elbows to create a straight line from your head to your heels. Hold for 30 seconds, focusing on keeping your core tight.
          Incline Plank: Use a bench or sturdy surface. Place your forearms on the bench and your feet on the floor, forming a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core and hold for 30 seconds.
          Knee Plank: Start in a standard plank position but with your knees on the ground instead of your toes. Keep your body in a straight line from head to knees, engaging your core. Hold for 30 seconds.`,
