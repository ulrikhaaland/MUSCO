        'The squat is the king of all exercises, working over 256 muscles in one movement! From bodybuilders to powerlifters to competitive athletes, the squat is a staple compound exercise and should be in every workout plan. For powerlifters, it is known as one of the “big three” lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, having an explosive squat is a good indicator for on field/court performance. And for bodybuilders, the squat is a compound exercise that targets nearly every muscle of your lower body and core. The squat directly targets the muscles of the quads, but also involves the hamstrings, glutes, back, and core as well as muscles of the shoulders and arms to a lesser degree. Not everyone is built to perform the traditional barbell back squat and it can result in some pain for certain individuals. Over the years, several squatting variations have been developed to help everyone be able to train this critical movement pattern safely. Some of the squat variations include: Bodyweight Squat Goblet Squat Landmine Squat Front Squat Dumbbell Squat Machine Hack Squat Smith Machine Squat The emphasis of the squat can be switched from the quads to the hamstrings by your foot placement. Some wear shoes with an elevated heel (or elevate their heels on plates) to focus more on the quads. Others keep a flat foot to put more pressure on the hamstrings. At the end of the day it is important that you pick a squat variation and foot placement that works best for you and that you can perform safely. Want to improve your squat?

        'Set up for the exercise by setting the barbell to just below shoulder height and loading the weight you want to use.',
        'Stand under the bar with your feet at about shoulder width apart.',
        'Position the bar so that it is resting on the muscles on the top of your back, not on the back of your neck. The bar should feel comfortable. If it doesn"t, try adding some padding to the bar.',
        'Now take your hands over the back and grip the bar with a wide grip for stability.',
        'You should now bend at the knees and straighten your back in preparation to take the weight off the rack.',

        'Common mistakes when squatting: ',
        'Rounding the lower back: It"s crucially important that you keep a straight back when you squat! You can ensure your back is straight by keeping your eyes facing forward, chest out, shoulder blades back, and back arched. Keep your core muscles tensed throughout the movement to help hold your back in place.',
        'Pushing from the balls of your feet: This puts unnecessary strain on joints and tendons. Always push up through your heels. Curling up your toes can help you get the technique right.',
        'Leaning forward: This happens when your hips move up faster than your shoulders. To prevent this keep the rep timing slow and controlled and stick your buttocks out as you go down.',
        'Knees come too far forward: When you squat down, your hips should be dropping straight down, not coming forward. Using a light weight, perfect your form standing side on to a mirror. Your knees should never track out and over your toes.',
        'Not squatting deep enough: Using squats to their full potential requires squatting down at least until your thighs are around parallel to the floor.',
        'Knees in or out: Don"t point your knees in or out when you"re lowering or pushing the weight. This puts unnecessary strain on the knee joints.',

      description:
        'The dumbbell Bulgarian split squat is an excellent exercise for those looking to build a stronger squat personal record. It can also be used to correct muscle imbalances some might experience over the years from strictly focusing on bilateral leg movements. The dumbbell Bulgarian split squat is a variation of the dumbbell lunge in which you elevate your rear foot. The elevation shifts the emphasis to the grounded foot and allows pressure to be placed directly on the quad. The dumbbell Bulgarian split squat is best considered an accessory movement, however, one can utilize them as a primary quad building exercise depending on their goals.',

      tips: [
        'You can utilize a bench for this variation but it may be slightly more uncomfortable on the ankle joint. As such, it may be wiser to use the pad on the leg extension machine or perhaps the squat pad attached to a bar at a lower height. Ideally the back foot should be positioned at knee height or slightly below. Setting the back foot too high will likely just drive your lumbar spine into excessive extension.',
        'If you want to emphasize the quads during the split squat, focus on taking a slightly smaller split stance and drive up through the ball of the foot.',
        'If you want to emphasize the glutes and hamstrings during the split squat, focus on taking a slightly larger split stance and drive up through the heel of the foot.',
        'If you’re an overextended athlete then you may find it more beneficial to allow for slightly more torso lean throughout the drill as this will help to keep your spine neutral and load the front leg more effectively.',

From here, push out against the band to engage the glute and keep yourself in a more neutral position.',

Often referred to as the reverse deadlift, the behind the back positioning of the bar in the barbell hack squat puts a lot of pressure on the quads to force them to grow. The barbell hack squat also indirectly targets other muscles of the leg as well as the core and low back. Most people choose not to barbell hack squat because of its challenging set up and execution.

Set up for the exercise by setting the barbell to just below shoulder height and loading the weight you want to use.',

        'The barbell thruster is a combination exercise that combines the movement patterns of the front squat with the movement of an overhead press. For this reason, the barbell thruster works the muscles of the legs and the muscles of the shoulders. The barbell thruster has been popularized by the sport of Crossfit. The movement has a lot of application in building strength, size, and explosiveness. However, it’s extremely technically demanding and should not be attempted until other exercises and variations have been mastered.',

        'The band resisted box squat is a variation of the box squat and an exercise used to strengthen the muscles of the legs. Primarily, the band resisted box squat targets the quadriceps, but will also indirectly work the muscles of the hamstrings, calves, glutes, and core. Box squats serve a couple of purposes. They can be used to help beginners learn the proper form of a back squat by providing an external cue to let lifters know when to reverse the movement. Box squats also serve rehabilitation purposes, especially for those coming off knee injuries or those learning how to eliminate the butt wink during squats. However, in this particular exercise, the band resisted box squat would be used by the powerlifting community to train the top portion of the lift with a maximal load. The added band resistance further overloads the top portion of the lift making the band resisted box squat the perfect option for those who have trouble at the top lockout of the back squat.',

      description:
        'The reverse band back squat is a variation of the back squat and an exercise used to strengthen the muscles of the legs. The use of bands when performing reverse band back squats provides assistance while you’re in the hole (at the bottom of the movement). This can be helpful if you’re trying to overload the top portion of the movement without fear of failing at your weaker part of the lift. Reverse band back squats are primarily used by the powerlifting community, but can be used by any training population looking to improve their overall squat personal record.',

        'Position the bar just below shoulder level and adjust the safety stops right above knee height. Once the bar has been loaded, attach bands to the top of the rack via pegs or the actual rack itself and then anchor the end of the bands around the bar to provide assistance.',

The leg extension is a great exercise for quad development and may be beneficial to include in your workout routines if your goals are more aesthetics-driven. The leg extension can be utilized in both leg workouts and full-body workouts.',

      description:
        "The bodyweight squat is a fundamental movement pattern that forms the foundation of lower body strength training. This exercise requires no equipment, making it perfect for beginners learning proper squat form and for those working out at home. While less intensive than its weighted counterparts, the bodyweight squat effectively targets the muscles of the lower body while also engaging the core for stability. It's an excellent exercise for developing proper form, building basic strength, improving mobility, and preparing for more advanced squat variations.",
