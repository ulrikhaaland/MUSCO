        'The Cable Crunch is an effective core exercise that targets the abdominal muscles, particularly the rectus abdominis. Unlike floor crunches, the cable crunch reduces neck strain by allowing you to focus on using your abs without needing to lift your head or shoulders. It also helps improve spinal flexion, a fundamental movement for building a strong, functional core. This exercise helps strengthen and define the core, improve posture, and enhance overall abdominal endurance. Proper form is crucial to avoid strain on the lower back and ensure maximum activation of the ab muscles.',

          Incline Plank: Use a bench or sturdy surface. Place your forearms on the bench and your feet on the floor, forming a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core and hold for 30 seconds.
          Knee Plank: Start in a standard plank position but with your knees on the ground instead of your toes. Keep your body in a straight line from head to knees, engaging your core. Hold for 30 seconds.`,

        'The abdominal crunch, or ab crunch, is a flexion based abdominal exercise. It is a very common movement that even the newest of beginner lifters have probably tried before. Most ab workouts include the ab crunch as it is thought to be one of the best core building exercises. However, instead of performing marathon sets of ab crunches, it is best to pair it with other ab movements such as the plank and hanging leg raise to get a complete ab workout. The ab crunch replaced the sit up as the corner stone ab exercise. This is because people believed the sit up involved too much flexion which lends itself to lower back pain. Thus, it was replaced by the ab crunch, which accomplished the same movement pattern without overextending the spine. Some may still experience low back pain performing the ab crunch. If this is the case, it is best to stick with ab exercises that focus more on stability and less on flexion such as the plank.',
