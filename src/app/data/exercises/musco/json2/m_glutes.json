      "description": "The glute bridge is a variation of the hip thrust and an exercise that is used to build the glute muscles. It will also indirectly target the other muscles of the legs such as the hamstrings, quads, and calves. hip thrust variations are thought to be the optimal exercise for glute specific training. So, if you have goals to build a bigger butt, hip thrusts should be included in your workouts. Building strong glutes will also have a positive carryover into your other exercises including squat variations and deadlift variations. Glute bridges can be included in your leg workouts and full body workouts.",

        "Start in a supine position on the floor with your arms at a 45 degree angle relative to your torso.",

        "Focus on exhaling as you bridge the hips up. You shouldn’t feel the movement through your lower back at all.",

A lot of lifters believe all you need to build a complete and strong set of glutes are exercises such as the squat and deadlift. However, this isn’t completely true. Implementing more isolation focused glute exercises such as the barbell glute bridge is a smart idea for aesthetics, functionality, and strength.",
