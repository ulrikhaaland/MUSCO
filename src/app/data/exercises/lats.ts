      description:
        'The behind the neck lat pull down is a variation of the lat pull down and an exercise used to build the muscles of the back. While the exercise will primarily target the lats, you will also notice a fair amount of bicep and middle back activation. Behind the neck exercises are seen as a dated practice as the range of motion can put the shoulder joint in an unfavorable position. Some tension can be alleviated by stopping the rep at the top of the neckline. That said, if you are experiencing pain while performing the exercise, it may be beneficial to experiment with other pull down variations. The behind the neck lat pull down can be performed during your back workouts, upper body workouts, pull workouts, and full body workouts.',
