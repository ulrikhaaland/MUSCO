      description:
        'The hip abduction machine exercise is an exercise used to strengthen the abductors. The abductors play a critical role in core stability and having strong abductors can result in better personal records on the squat and deadlift. From an aesthetic perspective, performing hip abduction isolation exercises assists in the development of a full pair of glutes and hips.',

      steps: [
        'Setup in an upright position with your back against the pad and your spine neutral.',

        'Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.',
      ],
      tips: [
        'Experiment with foot and pelvis position. Depending upon the shape of your hip, you may need a slightly more internal or external starting position to fully maximize the contraction.\n          Similarly, be mindful of your pelvic position - don’t allow the back to arch as this will tip the hips forward and place the adductors under excessive stretch before the contraction which can affect force output.\n          If you can’t seem to figure out how to change the position of your pelvis while seated, experiment with changing the position of the torso (i.e. lean forward or push your back into the pad).',

      name: 'Cable Hip Abduction',
      description:
        'The Cable Hip Abduction exercise targets the hip abductors, particularly the gluteus medius and minimus. This exercise helps strengthen the muscles responsible for stabilizing the hips and improving lateral movement. It"s effective for toning the glutes, improving hip mobility, and enhancing overall lower body strength and balance. Proper form is crucial to avoid unnecessary strain on the hip joint and ensure maximum muscle activation.',

        'Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, and hold onto the machine or nearby support for balance.',
        'Keeping your leg straight, lift the strapped leg out to the side, leading with the heel, and engage your glutes and hip muscles.',
        'Pause, then slowly return your leg to the starting position with control, resisting the cable tension.',
        'Perform the desired number of reps, then switch legs.',
        '',
      ],
      tips: [
        'Lift with control. Focus on raising your leg slowly and with control, avoiding swinging or jerking.',
        'When lifting your leg, lead with the heel to better activate the glutes and hip abductors.',
        'Engage your core to maintain stability and prevent excessive movement in your upper body.',
        'Raise your leg only to the point where you feel a strong contraction, not beyond your natural range of motion.',
