      description:
        'The bent over row is a back day staple exercise and is considered one of the best muscle building back building exercises you can do. Sometimes referred to as the barbell row, the bent over row is a staple movement in most muscle building workouts. Those looking to build muscle utilize the bent over row to target their back, bicep and core muscle. Those in powerlifting and strength circles perform bent over rows to increase their strength on the big 3 movements. The bent over row is typically used to build and strengthen the muscles of the upper back (latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and trapezius). However, it requires assistance from muscles of the low back, core, and arms to perform a bent over row correctly. There are several variations of the bent over row one can and should perform. Bent over row variations include: Dumbbell Bent Over Row One Arm Bent Over Dumbbell Row Reverse Grip Bent Over Row T-Bar Row Smith Machine Row The back is a tricky muscle group to build and strengthen. Sometimes it can help to vary the degree in which you perform the bent over row and well as the hand placement on the bar. Regardless, the bent over row is a great exercise to include in your back workout.',

        'The rowing machine exercise is a variation of the row and an exercise used to target the muscles of the upper back. The rowing motion will indirectly work the muscles of the legs, core, shoulders, and rest of the back. The rowing machine is primarily used as a form of cardio/conditioning. However, it can also be used as a finisher exercise during your pull or back workouts.',

      steps: [
        'Assume a seated position with your feet strapped into the footplates.',
        'Take a pronated (double overhand) grip on the bar and sit up upright with the legs and arms extended.',
        'Initiate the movement by flexing at the knees and hips while keeping the arms straight.',
        'Push your feet into the platform to straighten your legs, lean back slightly, and then proceed to row the handle towards your chest as you exhale to complete the movement.',
        'Return to the starting position by lengthening the arms and flexing at the knees and hips.',
        'Repeat for the desired time, duration, or distance.',
      ],
      tips: [
        'Keep some tone through your abdominals as you pull the handle into your body to ensure you don’t arch excessively through your spine.',
        'Most of the power should be generated through your lower body, don’t needlessly tire yourself out by only using the arms. Don’t let your hips shoot back and have to rely upon your lower back, utilize your core to keep yourself upright.',
        'Remember, you should extend the legs first before making your pull.',
        'Don’t allow the head to jut forward as you pull.',
        'Don’t try to crush the handle, only hold on tight enough so it doesn’t slip out of your hands. This will help to prevent you from overusing the forearms.',
        'Leaning back slightly after you’ve extended the legs to extend the hips will help. Think: “Legs, hips, arms” to drive the pull and then “Arms, legs, hips” to get back to your starting position.',
        'Think about pulling the handle to the bottom of your ribcage.',
        'Avoid sticking your elbows out to the sides (aka chicken wing phenomenon) when you pull.',
        'Wait until your arms have fully extended before you rebend the knees. Bend the knees too soon will cause contact with the handle.',
        'Don’t allow the seat to hit you in the heels, you’ve gone too far.',
        'Keep breathing - exhale on the pull and inhale on the recovery.',

      description:
        'A targeted upper back exercise using a resistance band anchored at upper abdominal height. This variation emphasizes the upper back muscles more than traditional rows due to the higher pulling angle. The exercise is particularly effective for improving posture and developing the rhomboids and middle trapezius muscles, while also engaging the rear deltoids.',
      targetBodyParts: ['Upper Back'],
      exerciseType: ['strength'],
      difficulty: 'beginner',
      equipment: ['Bands'],
      steps: [
        'Secure a resistance band to a sturdy anchor point at upper abdominal height (just below chest level).',
        'Stand facing the anchor point with feet shoulder-width apart, maintaining an athletic stance.',
        'Grasp the band with both hands, arms extended forward at upper ab height.',
        'Step back until you feel tension in the band while keeping your chest high.',
        'Initiate the pull by squeezing your shoulder blades together.',
        'Pull the band toward your upper abs/lower chest, keeping your elbows slightly higher than in a traditional row.',
        'Focus on maximally retracting your shoulder blades at the end position.',
        'Control the return to the starting position, maintaining tension throughout.',
        'Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.',
      ],
      tips: [
        'Keep your elbows at or slightly above band level throughout the movement.',
        'Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together rather than just pulling with your arms.',
        'Maintain a proud chest posture throughout the exercise.',
        'Avoid shrugging your shoulders - keep them down and back.',
        'The higher anchor point helps target the upper back more effectively.',
        'If you feel it too much in your arms, focus on leading the movement with your elbows.',
        'Keep your core engaged to prevent swaying or leaning back.',
