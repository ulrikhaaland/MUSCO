        'The dumbbell floor press is a variation of the floor press and an exercise used to strengthen the muscles of the triceps and chest. Primarily, the dumbbell floor press will target the muscles of the triceps. The limited range of motion effectively takes the chest somewhat out of the equation of the press. However, the chest can still be indirectly targeted when using the floor press. Simply focus on squeezing the pecs at the top of the movement. Floor presses, in generally, are particular helpful for those looking to build stronger triceps to help with locking out more compound press variations. They can also be beneficial for bodybuilders trying to add mass to their triceps.',

        'If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.',
        'The elbows will be tucked more than a normal bench due to the decrease grip width but if you experience shoulder pain during this variation you may have to slightly tweak grip width and elbow tuck to provide more space within the shoulder capsule.',
        'Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.',
        'The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.',

        'Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.',
        'Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.',
        'Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.',
        'Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.',
        'Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.',
        'Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.',
        'The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.',
        'Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.',
        'Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.',

        'Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.',
        'Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. To keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.',
        'If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.',
        'Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.',
        'Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.',
        'The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.',
        'As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm to promote a linear bar path.',
        'Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.',
        'Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.',
        'Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.',
        'Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.',
        'Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.',
        'The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.',
        'Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.',
        'Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.',
        'Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.',
        'Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.',

        'The tiger tail is an implement used to perform a form of self myo-fascial release. Using the tiger tail on the triceps is a great way to warm up and cool down for your workout, especially if you plan to perform upper body exercises that require the triceps to be more mobile. When you perform SMR on your triceps, or any muscle group for that matter, you alleviate some of the tension that is built up during the day and your workouts.',

      description:
        'The one-arm lying pronated dumbbell tricep extension is an exercise used to isolate the tricep muscles. Some believe that through rotating hand and grip positions, you can target different areas of the triceps. However, this is highly debated with this particular muscle group. So, when deciding whether or not to perform the one arm lying pronated dumbbell tricep extension over another variation, consider which hand placement feels most comfortable to you. Training the triceps in a unilateral fashion (one side at a time), as seen in the one arm lying pronated dumbbell tricep extension, is an excellent way to build a balanced and symmetrical pair of triceps.',

        'Do not allow the kettlebells to collide together at the top, this can take some tension off the pecs and also be potentially dangerous if you lose stability at the shoulder.',
        'Don’t bounce the elbows off the floor at the bottom of the rep. Doing so may result in injury due to the compressive forces being generated between the weight and the floor.',
        'Ensure you maintain some tension in your abs and don’t allow your lower back to arch excessively.',
