        'The dumbbell shrug is a variation of the shrug and an exercise used to build trap muscle size. Traps, being a stubborn muscle group for many, can be trained with a fairly high frequency during the week. When doing so, be sure to mix up the volume, intensity, and implements you use to train the traps. Dumbbell shrugs can be included into your shoulder workouts, back workouts, upper body workouts, and full body workouts.',

If you find that you have trouble keeping this neutral knee position, focus on spreading the floor by trying to push your feet apart as you push into the floor.

        'Make sure you wrap your thumbs around the kettlebell and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the handle as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the kettlebell.',
        'If you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow.

        'The sumo stance high pull is a variation of the high pull and an exercise used primarily to target the muscles of the shoulders and traps. The sumo high pull is somewhat of a combination exercise (combining a sumo deadlift with an upright row) and will target other muscles groups such as the upper back and hamstrings. High pulls are performed explosively, and since the traps respond well to explosive movements, will help with trap muscle growth. They also have a significant amount of application in sports-specific training where explosiveness is an important indicator for performance.',
