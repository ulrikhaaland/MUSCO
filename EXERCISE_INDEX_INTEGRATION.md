# Exercise Index Integration - LLM Knowledge Base

## Overview
The LLM now has **explicit knowledge** of all 114 exercises in the database, enabling intelligent, specific recommendations instead of blind queries.

---

## What Changed

### **Before** ❌
```
User: "What's best for rotator cuff?"
LLM: "Try rotator cuff exercises <<EXERCISE_QUERY:Shoulders:>>"
     ↑ Generic, doesn't know specific exercises exist
```

### **After** ✅
```
User: "What's best for rotator cuff?"
LLM: "For rotator cuff health, I recommend **Cable Face Pull** and 
      **Band Pull Apart** - both strengthen posterior shoulder stabilizers.
      <<EXERCISE_QUERY:Shoulders:face pull>>"
     ↑ Specific exercises by name, with reasoning
```

---

## Architecture

### Index Generation
```
JSON files → generate-exercise-index.ts → exerciseIndex.ts
                                             ↓
                                    explorePrompt.ts (injected)
                                             ↓
                                       LLM receives index
```

### Token Budget
- **Full index**: ~761 tokens (114 exercises with formatting)
- **Compact index**: ~466 tokens (selected exercises, condensed)
- **Current usage**: Compact format (~2221 tokens total prompt)

---

## Files Created/Modified

### **NEW: `scripts/generate-exercise-index.ts`**
Generates exercise index from JSON files.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run generate:exercise-index
```

**Output:**
- `src/app/api/prompts/exerciseIndex.ts` (auto-generated)
- Statistics printed to console
- Token estimates for both formats

**Features:**
- Reads all exercise JSON files
- Groups by body part
- Limits to top 8-12 exercises per category (token efficiency)
- Exports 3 formats: FULL, COMPACT, RAW (JSON)

### **NEW: `src/app/api/prompts/exerciseIndex.ts`**
Auto-generated exercise index (DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY).

**Exports:**
- `EXERCISE_INDEX_FULL`: Detailed format with examples
- `EXERCISE_INDEX_COMPACT`: Condensed format (used in prompt)
- `EXERCISE_INDEX_RAW`: JSON object for programmatic access

### **MODIFIED: `src/app/api/prompts/explorePrompt.ts`**
Imports and injects exercise index into system prompt.

**Changes:**
1. Imports `EXERCISE_INDEX_COMPACT`
2. Injects via template string: `${EXERCISE_INDEX_COMPACT}`
3. Updated Rule 8 with:
   - Exercise index
   - Usage instructions
   - Specific examples
   - Critical rules

### **MODIFIED: `package.json`**
Added npm script:
```json
"generate:exercise-index": "ts-node scripts/generate-exercise-index.ts"
```

### **NEW: `scripts/test-exercise-prompt.ts`**
Integration test to verify prompt includes exercise index.

## Prompt Injection Format

### Compact Format (Used in Production)
```
**Exercise Database** (reference for specific recommendations):
• Shoulders: Dumbbell Lateral Raise, Military Press, Seated Arnold Press, Cable Face Pull, Band Pull Apart...
• Upper Arms: Standing Hammer Curl, Dumbbell Curl, EZ Bar Curl, Rope Tricep Extension...
• Chest: Dumbbell Bench Press, Incline Dumbbell Press, Push Up...
• Glutes: Barbell Glute Bridge, Single-Leg Hip Thrust, Side Lying Hip Abduction...
[etc.]
```

### LLM Instructions
```
**How to use exercises:**
1. Reference specific exercises by name from the index
2. Insert query markers: <<EXERCISE_QUERY:bodypart:exercise_name>>
3. Explain why the exercise is appropriate
4. Never list exercises in bullet points

**Examples:**
• "For rotator cuff, I recommend **Cable Face Pull** <<EXERCISE_QUERY:Shoulders:face pull>>"
• "**Barbell Glute Bridge** builds glute strength <<EXERCISE_QUERY:Glutes:glute bridge>>"
```

---

## Benefits

### 1. **Intelligent Recommendations**
LLM can now:
- Reference exercises by name
- Suggest specific variations (e.g., "Cable Face Pull" vs generic "shoulder exercise")
- Explain why certain exercises fit user's context

### 2. **Context-Aware Selection**
LLM sees:
- Exercise names
- Body part categories
- Can infer difficulty/equipment from names

### 3. **Token Efficient**
- Only ~466 tokens for compact index
- Covers all 114 exercises
- Updated via single npm command

### 4. **Maintainable**
```bash
# Add new exercises to JSON files
# Then regenerate:
npm run generate:exercise-index
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Specific Recommendation
```
User: "I have weak rotator cuffs, what helps?"

LLM Response:
"For rotator cuff strengthening, I recommend **Cable Face Pull** and 
**Band Pull Apart** - both target the posterior shoulder stabilizers 
critical for shoulder health and injury prevention.

<<EXERCISE_QUERY:Shoulders:face pull>>"

Result: 3 exercise cards displayed (Face Pull + 2 similar)
```

### Example 2: Progressive Difficulty
```
User: "Beginner glute exercises?"

LLM Response:
"Start with **Bodyweight Glute Bridge** to build foundational strength, 
then progress to **Barbell Glute Bridge** as you get stronger.

<<EXERCISE_QUERY:Glutes:glute bridge>>"

Result: Shows glute bridge variations
```

### Example 3: Equipment-Specific
```
User: "No gym, home workout for chest?"

LLM Response:
"**Push Up** is the best bodyweight chest exercise. You can modify 
difficulty with hand placement.

<<EXERCISE_QUERY:Chest:push up>>"

Result: Shows push-up variations
```

## Testing

### Manual Test
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open 3D viewer
3. Select "Shoulders"
4. Click "Explore this area"
5. Ask: "What's best for rotator cuff?"
6. Verify LLM mentions specific exercises by name
7. Verify exercise cards appear

### Integration Test
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/test-exercise-prompt.ts
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Prompt loaded successfully
✅ Total length: 8883 characters
✅ Estimated tokens: 2221

## Maintenance

### When to Regenerate Index

Regenerate when:
- ✅ New exercises added to JSON files
- ✅ Exercise names changed
- ✅ Body part categories modified

### How to Regenerate

```bash
npm run generate:exercise-index
```

This will:
1. Read all JSON files from `public/data/exercises/musco/json2/`
2. Extract exercise names
3. Generate `exerciseIndex.ts`
4. Print statistics

### Verify Changes

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/test-exercise-prompt.ts
```

---

## Token Budget Management

### Current Allocation
```
Base prompt:           ~1,755 tokens
Exercise index (compact): ~466 tokens
Total:                 ~2,221 tokens
```

### If Token Limit Reached

**Option 1: Reduce exercises per category**
```typescript
// In generate-exercise-index.ts
grouped[mainPart].push(...data.exercises.slice(0, 6)); // Was 8
```

**Option 2: Use full format only for specific modes**
```typescript
// In explorePrompt.ts
${userContext.needsDetailedExercises ? EXERCISE_INDEX_FULL : EXERCISE_INDEX_COMPACT}
```

**Option 3: RAG-style injection**
Only inject exercises for selected body part (requires architecture change).

## Future Enhancements

### Planned
- [ ] Include difficulty levels in index
- [ ] Include equipment requirements
- [ ] Add contraindications (brief)
- [ ] Norwegian exercise index generation

### Possible
- [ ] Dynamic index based on user equipment
- [ ] Personalized index based on user level
- [ ] Exercise similarity scoring for recommendations
- [ ] Exercise progression pathways

---

## Troubleshooting

### LLM Not Referencing Specific Exercises
1. Check prompt includes index: `npx ts-node scripts/test-exercise-prompt.ts`
2. Verify `explorePrompt.ts` imports `EXERCISE_INDEX_COMPACT`
3. Check template string interpolation: `${EXERCISE_INDEX_COMPACT}`

### Index Out of Date
```bash
npm run generate:exercise-index
```

### Build Errors
```bash
# Type-check just the prompt files
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck src/app/api/prompts/explorePrompt.ts
```

---

## Implementation Details

### Index Generation Algorithm
```typescript
1. Read all JSON files from json2/
2. For each file:
   - Extract exercise names
   - Track equipment, difficulty
   - Group by body part
3. For each body part:
   - Limit to 8-12 exercises (token efficiency)
   - Deduplicate
4. Generate 3 formats:
   - FULL: Detailed with formatting
   - COMPACT: Condensed, one-line per category
   - RAW: JSON object
5. Write to exerciseIndex.ts
```

### Prompt Injection Strategy
```typescript
// explorePrompt.ts
import { EXERCISE_INDEX_COMPACT } from './exerciseIndex';

export const exploreSystemPrompt = `
...
**8. Exercise Database Integration**

${EXERCISE_INDEX_COMPACT}  // ← Injected at build time

**How to use exercises:**
...
`;
```
